          Here is a brief summary of why I am doing this for my final year
          project and how the Smart Tabs Application Window Formatter works.
          During my work placement last year, I was constantly switching
          application windows and tabs as I could be using up to ten different
          windows at any one time. This caused some frustration and I felt like
          there had to be an easier way to solve this whenever all the windows
          get jumbled around the desktop work space. This is when my final year
          project idea was born. As soon as I started my fourth year in college
          I quickly began researching the best way to accomplish this. The way I
          have come up for the application window formatter to work is by simply
          running a Python script that implements the win32gui libraries to
          format the specific application windows that have been chosen and
          assigning them at different points on the desktop workspace. This is
          done by moving the windows to the X and Y co-ordinates on the screen
          and then specifying what their length and width should be in pixel
          count. As for now I have the general workings done on the Python
          script and have done the majority of the front-end work of the Smart
          Tabs website.
